<h1>Playing the Game</h1>
<p>This chapter is all about how to play this game. Here, you&#146;ll find information about the core rules &ndash; other more specific parts will be handled later.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The game is structured in several layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>The core &ndash; these are the most basic principles of the game and they will be explained in this chapter.</li>
<li>The flavor &ndash; while still being part of the fundamentals of the game, you can exchange certain details here if they better match your genre.</li>
<li>The details &ndash; here you can find rules that are specific to this game.</li>
<li>The custom part &ndash; handles suggestions, optional rules, more detailed rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each layer by itself can be regarded as a complete playable game, with the more detailed rules shaping the atmosphere and feel of the game &ndash; so, feel free to leave out the more detailed rules if you don&rsquo;t like them, or replace them with something else.</p>
<h2>The Players</h2>
<h3>The Core Mechanic</h3>
As a player you&rsquo;ll you describe what your character is doing and feeling in the fiction. There will be a lot of things that you can do just like that, because the outcome is certain. Sometimes the outcome of an action is not so certain, and in order to find out what happens.<p>
<p>In such a case, roll two six-sided dice, add the results (and sometimes additional modifiers), then see how much you got:
<ul>
<li>On a total of 10 or higher (written 10+), the best happens: you get what you wanted.</li>
<li>On a total of 7&ndash;9, it&rsquo;s good but complicated: still a success but it comes with compromises or cost.</li>
<li>On a total of 6 or lower  (written 6&ndash;), it's never nothing, it&rsquo;s always something worse.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>The Game Master</h2>
<h3>Agenda</h3>
<p>Your agenda makes up the things you aim to do at all times while GMing the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the world seem real</li>
<li>Fill the characters&rsquo; lives with adventure</li>
<li>Play to find out what happens</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything you say and do at the table (and away from the table, too) exists to accomplish these three goals and no others. Things that aren&rsquo;t on this list aren&rsquo;t your goals. You&rsquo;re not trying to beat the players or test their ability to solve complex traps. You&rsquo;re not here to give the players a chance to explore your finely crafted setting. You&rsquo;re not trying to kill the players (though monsters might be). You&rsquo;re most certainly not here to tell everyone a planned-out story.</p>
<p>Your first agenda is to <strong>make the world seem real</strong>. Fill the world with people that have their own hopes and dreams, give them something to hold on to. They are not some mindless puppets that feed the story to the players, they are real people in the fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Filling the characters&rsquo; lives with adventure</strong> means working with the players to create a world that&rsquo;s engaging and dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> presume player actions. Try to portray a setting in motion, and let the characters&rsquo; actions matter in the world: As the players come into conflict with that setting and its denizens, action is inevitable. You&rsquo;ll honestly portray the repercussions of that action.</p>
<p>This is how you <strong>play to find out what happens</strong>: You have to commit yourself to the game&rsquo;s fiction&rsquo;s own internal logic and causality, driven by the players&rsquo; characters. You have to open yourself to caring what happens, but when it comes time to say what happens, you have to set what you hope for aside. The reward for playing the game this way comes with the discipline. When you find something you genuinely care about &ndash; a question about what will happen that you genuinely want to find out &ndash; letting the game&rsquo;s fiction decide it is uniquely satisfying.</p>
<h3>Always say</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What the principles demand (as follow).</strong></li>
<li><strong>What the rules demand.</strong></li>
<li><strong>What your prep demands.</strong></li>
<li><strong>What honesty demands.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The players&rsquo; job is to say what their characters say and undertake to do, first and exclusively; to say what their characters think, feel and remember, also exclusively; and to answer your questions about their characters&rsquo; lives and surroundings.</p>
<p>Your job as GM is to say everything else: everything about the world, and what everyone in the world says and does except the players&rsquo; characters.</p>
<p>Always be scrupulous, even generous, with the truth. The players depend on you to give them real information they can really use, about their characters&rsquo; surroundings, about what&rsquo;s happening when and where.</p>
<p>Same with the game&rsquo;s rules: play with integrity and an open hand. The players are entitled to the full benefits of their moves, their rolls, their characters&rsquo; strengths and resources. Don&rsquo;t chisel them, don&rsquo;t weasel, don&rsquo;t play gotcha.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re playing the game as the players&rsquo; adversary, your decision-making responsibilities and your rules-oversight constitute a conflict of interests. Play the game with the players, not against them.</p>
<h3>Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Propagate the setting and genre</li>
<li>Address the characters, not the players</li>
<li>Make a move that follows</li>
<li>Never speak the name of your move</li>
<li>Name every person and give them life</li>
<li>Ask questions and build on the answers</li>
<li>Be a fan of the characters</li>
<li>Think dangerous</li>
<li>Think offscreen, too</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever someone turns and looks to you to say something, always say what the principles demand.</p>
<p>Your principles are your guides. Often, when it&rsquo;s time to make a move, you&rsquo;ll already have an idea of what makes sense. Consider it in light of your principles and go with it, if it fits.</p>
<h4>Propagate the setting and genre</h4>
<p>You are creating a fictional and interesting world together, and often you will be playing in a certain setting or genre. Paint this setting together with the players, incorporate their ideas as well as yours, try to help them stay on the same page.</p>
<p>For a fantasy game this might mean that the characters have to deal with magic, strange vistas, gods, demons, and abominations: the world is full of mystery and magic. In a dystopian setting you may want to emphasize the feelings of isolation and personal horror, or abrupt violence, the destruction and downfall of morals or technology.</p>
<h4>Address the characters, not the players</h4>
<p>Addressing the characters, not the players, means that you don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Tony, is Dunwick doing something about that wight?&rdquo; Instead you say, &ldquo;Dunwick, what are you doing about the wight?&rdquo; Speaking this way keeps the game focused on the fiction and not on the table. It&rsquo;s important to the flow of the game, too. If you talk to the players you may leave out details that are important to what moves the characters make. Since moves are always based on the actions of the character you need to think about what&rsquo;s happening in terms of those characters &ndash; not the players portraying them.</p>
<h4>Make a move that follows</h4>
<p>When you make a move what you&rsquo;re actually doing is taking an element of the fiction and bringing it to bear against the characters. Your move should always follow from the fiction. They help you focus on one aspect of the current situation and do something interesting with it. What&rsquo;s going on? What move makes sense here?</p>
<h4>Never speak the name of your move</h4>
<p>There is no quicker way to ruin the immersion than to tell the players what move you&rsquo;re making. Your moves are prompts to you, not things you say directly.</p>
<p>You never show the players that you&rsquo;re picking a move from a list. You know the reason the slavers dragged off Omar was because you made the &ldquo;put someone in a spot&rdquo; move, but you show it to the players as a straightforward outcome of their actions, since it is.</p>
<h4>Name every person and give them life</h4>
<p>Anyone that the players speak with has a name. They probably have a personality and some goals or opinions too, but you can figure that out as you go. Start with a name. The rest can flow from there, as you make your NPCs do what they want to do, when they want to do it.</p>
<p>All of this applies to the players&rsquo; adversaries, too: Give enemies or monsters some straightforward, sensible self-interests &ndash; make them more than puppets to be killed off, make them care for their own lives first.</p>
<h4>Ask questions and build on the answers</h4>
<p>Part of playing to find out what happens is explicitly not knowing everything, and being curious:</p>
<p>The easiest question to use is &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo;. Ask them for their feelings, opinions, and fears. If you don&rsquo;t know something, or you don&rsquo;t have an idea, ask the players and use what they say.</p>
<p>Add your own visions and imagery to it, and refer to the ideas and reinforce them in the game later again, add details where you formerly left a blank space.</p>
<h4>Be a fan of the characters</h4>
<p>Think of the players&rsquo; characters as protagonists in a story you might see on TV. Cheer for their victories and lament their defeats. You&rsquo;re not here to push them in any particular direction, merely to participate in fiction that features them and their action.</p>
<h4>Think dangerous</h4>
<p>Everything in the world is a target. You&rsquo;re thinking like an evil overlord: no single life is worth anything and there is nothing sacrosanct. Everything can be put in danger, everything can be destroyed. Nothing you create is ever protected. Whenever your eye falls on something you&rsquo;ve created, think how it can be put in danger, fall apart or crumble. The world changes. Without the characters&rsquo; intervention, it changes for the worse.</p>
<h4>Think offscreen too</h4>
<p>Just because you&rsquo;re a fan of the characters doesn&rsquo;t mean everything happens right in front of them.  When it&rsquo;s time for you to make a move, imagine what your many various NPCs must have been doing meanwhile. Have any of them done something offscreen that now becomes evident? Are any of them doing things offscreen that, while invisible to the players&rsquo; characters, deserve your quiet notice? This is part of making the world seem real &ndash; and if you pay attention to your threats, it&rsquo;s part of making the characters&rsquo; lives not boring too.</p>
