	</ul>
	<p>Stats can go from -3 to +3, but are usually from -1 to +2. That's the number you add or subtract from your roll when you roll+that stat.</p>
	<p>If a rule says, for instance, &ldquo;you get stat+3&rdquo;, that means your stat goes to +3, no matter what it was before. If it says &ldquo;you get +1 stat&rdquo;, that means that you increase your current stat by 1.</p>
