<h2>Stats</h2>

	<p>Characters have the following stats:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cool</strong> means calm, collected, patient, ruthless, calculating, unfazed, disciplined, controlled, confident.</li>
		<li><strong>Hard</strong> means hard-hearted, fierce, violent, aggressive, savage, vicious, strong-willed.</li>
		<li><strong>Sharp</strong> means sharp-witted, alert, smart, perceptive, clever, cunning.</li>
		<li><strong>Hot</strong> means good with people, inspiring, enticing, interesting, captivating, easy to get in touch with, warm, caring, passionate.</li>
		<li><strong>Genius</strong> means inventive, creative, out of the ordinary, exceptional, mysterious, passion for detail.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Stats can go from -3 to +3, but are usually from -1 to +2. That's the number you add or subtract from your roll when you roll+that stat.</p>
	<p>If a rule says, for instance, &ldquo;you get stat+3&rdquo;, that means your stat goes to +3, no matter what it was before. If it says &ldquo;you get +1 stat&rdquo;, that means that you increase your current stat by 1.</p>
	
	<h3>Assigning stats</h3>
	<p>When you create a new character, pick one array and assign its values to your stats:</p>
	<table>
		<tr><td>&#x2734;  </td><td align="right">+3,</td><td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">-1,</td><td align="right">-1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&#x2734;  </td><td align="right">+2,</td><td align="right">+2,</td><td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">-1,</td><td align="right">-1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&#x2734;  </td><td align="right">+2,</td><td align="right">+1,</td><td align="right">+1,</td><td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">-1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&#x2734;  </td><td align="right">+2,</td><td align="right">+1,</td><td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">0</td></tr>
	</table>
	<!-- You can create other arrays, using a point-buy-method. You get 9 points.
	<table>
		<tr><th>Stat Value</th><th>Point Cost</th>
		<tr>-1<td></td><td>0</td></tr>
		<tr> 0<td></td><td>1</td></tr>
		<tr>+1<td></td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr>+2<td></td><td>4</td></tr>
		<tr>+3<td></td><td>7</td></tr>
	</table>
    <p>If you do so, keep in mind that some combinations might just not be interesting, because they create either a one-trick-pony or a character that is not really bad or good at anything.</p>
	<p>Another variation had 14 points and costs of -2/0, -1/1, 0/2,  +1/3, +2/5, +3/8, but we decided against -2, because it makes you get a dump stat essentially.</p>-->
	
	<h3>Backgrounds</h3><!-- not finalized -->
	<p>Backgrounds tell something about the history of your character: where they grew up, what they learned, who they know. Backgrounds are used in certain moves and go from +1 to +3.</p>
	<p>When you create a new character, <strong>assign 3 background points</strong>: one background at +3, or one at +2 and one at +1, or three at +1 each.</p>
	<p>You can give each background a description, add some notes to it. It should be descriptive enough so that you can later tell what it was about, and it can relate to a location, event, item, or person, or whatever you can think of.</p>

<h2>Basic moves</h2>
	

	<h3>Confront</h3>
	<p>when you <strong>confront someone and appeal to their conscience or reason</strong>, roll+hot. On a hit they will reconsider their course of action:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ they take the blow and are open to your suggestions.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 they admit that you have a point, but are reserved and want something from you in return.</li>
		<li>On a 6- they reverse the blow, prepare for the worst.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As the name suggests, this is used primarily for convincing someone to either do or not do something. You can stand up to violence this way, talk sense into someone, or bring them back on course.</p>
	<p>In contrast to <strong>deceive</strong>, you are using facts, and your honest opinion when confronting someone, which means that you cannot simply spout nonsense and expect other characters to believe that.</p>
	<p>When they ask you for something in return that can be anything reasonable, not necessarily something that relates to your suggestion, but rather to their needs. So, if you want someone to stop harassing your friend they might go along, but only if you help them impress that girl they like &ndash; and so on.</p>
	<p>You can also use this move when you play out negotiations, business deals, or hostage situations.</p>



	<h3>Defy Danger</h3>
	<p>when you <strong>act despite an imminent threat</strong> or <strong>suffer a calamity</strong> roll+cool</p>
	<!--say how you deal with it. If you do it &#133;</p>
	<ul class="Ellipsis">
		<li>by powering through, roll+hard.</li>
		<li>by acting fast or getting out of the way, roll+sharp</li>
		<li>with mental fortitude or by enduring, roll+cool</li>
		<li>with charm, social grace, or a bluff, roll+hot</li>
	</ul>--><ul>
		<li>On a 10+ you do what you set out to do, the danger does not come to bear.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 you stumble, hesitate, or flinch. The GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or an ugly choice.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Understand danger as any kind of threat or serious pressure, when it's essential to keep calm, not freak out, act disciplined and accurate. Most of the time when a character does something and you have the feeling that it demands a roll, they will be defying danger very likely.</p>
	<p>Keep in mind to treat a 7-9 fundamentally as a success, not a failure, but that success comes at a cost.</p>



	<h3>Help or Interfere</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>help or interfere with someone who is making a roll</strong>, roll+hot.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ they take +2 <em>(help)</em> or -2 <em>(interfere)</em> to their roll.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 they take +1 <em>(help)</em> or -1 <em>(interfere)</em> to their roll.</li>
		<li>On a 6- you expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Always ask how the character helps, if the player does not describe it. If several persons are helping that's good, but only the highest bonus or worst penalty counts. Also, you cannot use this move on itself.</p>
	<p>When you help or hinder an NPC the situation is a little bit different, because they don't roll. Still, you can help or interfere, so here are your options.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ choose two.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 choose one.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>They get the job done a little faster (help).</li>
		<li>They are grateful and will remember you (help).</li>
		<li>They conserve stamina or resources (help).</li>
		<li>The result is of higher quality than without your help (help).</li>
		<li>You lessen a risk that they would suffer (help).</li>
		<li>They get some of what they want, but not all of it (interfere).</li>
		<li>You bind their attention, giving someone else time to act (interfere).</li>
		<li>They exhaust themselves or spend resources (interfere).</li>
		<li>You dismay or startle them and they will remember you (interfere).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Giving a bonus or penalty to someone who is making a roll has higher priority in this case. So, if you bind the attention of an NPC, so that someone else can <strong>defy danger</strong> and sneak past them, you help them with their roll.</p>



	<h3>Read a Person</h3>
	<p>When you read a <strong>read a person in a charged situation</strong>, roll+sharp.</p>
	<p>While you are interacting with them you get to ask questions about them over the course of the interaction. Whenever you act on the answers you have advantage.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ you get to ask three questions.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 you get to ask one question.</li>
		<li>On a 6- you get to ask one question anyway, but be prepared for the worst.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Choose from the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Is your character telling the truth?</li>
		<li>What is your character really feeling?</li>
		<li>What does your character intend to do?</li>
		<li>What does your character wish I would do?</li>
		<li>How could I get your character to &#133;?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Reading a person means studying their behaviour carefully throughout the entire conversation, noticing changes in their tone, their gestures and facial expressions, movement of the eyes.</p>
	<p>Roll this only when (a) the interaction really matters and (b) you're going to play the interaction through.</p>
	<p>As a GM you may already know the answers, or you have to make something up. Either way, you have to commit to the answers being true when you give them, and most likely the other person does not expect you knowing about that &ndash; that's what the +1 is good for.</p>
	<p>As a player you can make the roll at the very beginning of the conversation, or at any point during it. It's fair to wait for just the right opportunity to ask the question, and there is no rush to ask all questions before the conversation ends: At the end of interaction you can ask any of the remaining questions.</p>
	<p>During the interaction it can occur that you want to make a different move, such as talking sense into someone or put leverage on them. That's OK, and remember that you get +1 when you use the knowledge you gained from one of the answers.</p>
	<p>Finally, you cannot keep reading someone again and again unless there was a significant change in between. Players reading each other is also not a problem &ndash; they just roll and get to ask each other questions as they go along with the conversation.</p>



	<h3>Read a Situation</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>attempt to find out the truth</strong> in a tense situation, roll+sharp</p>
	<p>On a hit you can ask the GM questions. Whenever you act on the answers you have advantage.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ you get to ask three questions.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 you get to ask one question.</li>
		<li>On a 6- you get to ask one question anyway, but be prepared for the worst.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A character cannot read the same situation more than once.</p>
	<p>As a GM you may already know the answers, or you have to make something up. In the latter case you can also ask the players to help you answer, especially if the situation is one of the character&rsquo; making.</p>
	<p>Either way, you have to commit to the answers being true when you give them, that's what the +1 is good for.</p>
	<p>The questions can be arbitrary, but before you answer, tell the player whether that would use up one of their questions. Asking about mere facts does not use up a question, and the players should be aware of that.</p>
	<p>Here's a list of questions that will likely come up:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What happened here recently?</li>
		<li>What is about to happen?</li>
		<li>What should I be on the lookout for?</li>
		<li>What here is useful or valuable to me?</li>
		<li>Who's really in control here?</li>
		<li>What here is not what it appears to be?</li>
		<li>Where is my best escape route / way in / way out?</li>
		<li>Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?</li>
		<li>Which enemy is the biggest threat?</li>
	</ul>
	

	
	<h3>Seduce or Manipulate</h3>
	<p>When you try to <strong>manipulate, goad, or trick someone</strong>, tell them what you want them to do, give them a reason, and roll+sharp.</p>
	<p>When you want to <strong>seduce them</strong>, roll+hot instead.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ they go along with you, unless or until some fact or action betrays the reason you gave them.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 as above, but they want some concrete assurance or evidence first.</li>
		<li>If you deceive another player and they go along with you, they mark experience, but they can still refuse the offer and get nothing instead.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Use this when you want someone to do something for you, without doing anything in return. In order to do so, you need leverage that you can hold against them: a reason, a threat, a promise, or something that the character can really do that the victim really wants or does not want.</p>
	<p>If the NPC needs assurance, it should directly address the leverage that the character is using. The leverage is sex? The assurance should be sexual. The assurance is violence? They want a promise that you won't hurt them.</p>
	<p>In case there is no leverage this move does not apply &ndash; they are just talking, and your NPCs should agree or refuse according to their own interests.</p>


	<h3>Unleash Violence</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>unleash violence</strong> to force someone's course of action, roll+hard.</p>
	<p>On a 10+ they have to choose one:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They yield and do what you want.</li>
		<li>They give you no other choice and take the blow. Inflict harm as established.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On a 7-9 they can either choose one from above, or one of the following:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>They get out of your way as fast as they can.</li>
		<li>They dive behind cover or barricade themselves in securely.</li>
		<li>They back off calmly, hands where you can see them, not posing a threat.</li>
		<li>They give you something they think you want, or tell you what you want to hear.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On a miss prepare for the worst.</p>
	<p>Use this if you care about what they do, when they cannot fight back, and if you mean to actually hurt them.</p>
	<p>Unleashing violence means threating or attacking someone when they are not prepared or willing to fight against you. Use it when your character is definitely the aggressor and the target is surprised, refuses to fight back, cannot fight back effectively, or defies your threat and attempts to do something while you are attacking.</p>
	<p>If the target chooses to take the blow, you cannot decide to spare them, it's gone too far for that. Inflict harm on the target according to the weapon you use and their armor.</p>
	<p>On a 7-9 they have the chance to barely evade your attack &ndash; treat that result as a glancing blow or near miss. However, you now have their attention and you force them to change course, give ground, or retreat to a safer position. Don't take the descriptions too literally.</p>
	<p>More important, if none of the options from 7-9 make sense in the given situation, they cannot take them and <em>must</em> either do as you want, or take harm.</p>
	<p>In combat, it's a valid strategy to <strong>defy danger</strong> so that you get into a position where you can <strong>unleash violence</strong> on them.</p>
	<!-- This is also a little like defy danger, just turned around, so maybe add options from there. -->



	<h3>Sucker Someone</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>attack someone unsuspecting or helpless</strong>, ask the GM if you could miss.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If you could, <strong>unleash violence</strong> on them and they cannot choose to yield and <em>must</em> take the harm.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, inflict harm as established.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Suckering someone means attacking them when they are completely unaware of the attack or when they can do absolutely nothing to prevent the attack or evade its effect.</p>
	<p>When you are in doubt because the situation is not perfectly clear, that's fine, roll <strong>unleash violence</strong> instead.</p> 



	<h3>Think Deeply</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>consult your accumulated knowledge about something</strong>, choose an appropriate background and roll+background.</p>
	<p>If you have no appropriate background, or when you <strong>let your ideas flow</strong>, roll+genius.</p>
	<p>Tell the GM what you want to know, and:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ the GM will tell you something interesting and tell you how you can use that in your current situation. If you act on the answer, you have advantage.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 the GM will tell you something interesting, but you'll have to make use of it yourself.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You take a moment to ponder the things you know or learned about a certain topic and then reveal that knowledge, or you let your mind wander and find a connection or correlation that you previously did not see. No mather what the result of your roll is, the answers are alwasys true, even if the GM had to make them up on the spot.</p>
	<p>The knowledge you get is similar to consulting a compendium or looking something up in a library, or the practical knowledge that you would get from a teacher or instructor.</p>
	<p>On a miss, never give out false information! Instead, while they are sunken into deep thought they can easily miss what's going on around them. Even better, they find out what they wanted to know, but also discover an unwelcome truth!</p>

<h2>Battle moves</h2>
	

	<h3>Seize by Force</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>attack someone, or take something by force</strong> and they are fighting back, roll+hard and exchange harm.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ choose 3.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 choose 2.</li>
		<li>On a 6- choose 1.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can choose from several options here. The following have to do mainly with how hard the involved parties fight:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You suffer little harm (suffer -1harm).</li>
		<li>You spare your enemy, or they give up early (deal -1harm).</li>
		<li>You inflict terrible harm (inflict +1harm).</li>
		<li>You break their defenses (the attack is ap:1)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>And the next options give you options for reaching specific goals:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You impress, frighten, or dismay your enemy.</li>
		<li>You definitely and undeniably&ndash;
			<ul class="Ellipsis">
				<li>take control of something they have.</li>
				<li>keep control of something you have.</li>
				<li>assault secure position, by forcing your way in.</li>
				<li>disengage or fight your way free, allowing you to get away.</li>
				<li>protect someone else from their attack.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>You recover from a bad position (remove your disadvantage and their advantage).</li>
		<li>You get the upper hand (gain advantage when rolling against them, they suffer when rolling disadvantage against you).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Do this if you care about what they have, if you want to take it from them, and if they are able to fight back.</p>
	<p>An impressed, dismayed, or frightened NPC <em>absolutely must</em> change their behavior, but it is up to the GM how. For PCs if they want to continue anyway, they have to <strong>defy danger</strong> to do it.</p> 

	
	
	<h3>Lay down Fire</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>lay down fire</strong>, roll+sharp.</p><!-- was: +hard; changed it for better balance, and you have to be alert in order to understand where the enemy pops up and where your barrage is effective -->
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ choose 3.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 choose 2.</li>
		<li>On a 6- choose 1.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>You provide covering fire, allowing another character to act or move freely.</li>
		<li>You provide supporting fire, giving another PC +1 to their roll.</li>
		<li>You provide suppressing fire, denying another character to move or act freely. If the character is a PC, they still may <strong>defy danger</strong> if they want to do so.</li>
		<li>You take an opportune shot, inflicting little harm (-1harm) on an enemy within your reach.</li>
	</ul>
	


	<h3>Stand Overwatch</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>stand overwatch</strong> for an ally, roll+cool. If anyone attacks or interferes with your ally, you are able to <strong>warn your ally</strong> and:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>On a 10+ you attack them, inflict harm as established, and (choose one) &#133;
		<ul class="Ellipsis">
			<li>you inflict your harm before they can carry out their attack or interference.</li>
			<li>you inflict terrible harm (+1harm).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>On a 7-9 you attack them, inflict harm as established, but they already began attacking or interfering. Your ally still has a chance to act, because you warned them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This works well for snipers, or bodyguards who stand nearby. The difference here lies in the fiction and the range of the weapon that you employ &ndash; if you're a few hundred yards away you won't be able to inclict harm with a knife, because it is out of range.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2>Peripheral moves</h2>
<p>As with basic moves, anyone can use these, but they won't come up that often.</p>
	
<h3>Stabilize</h3>
<p>When you <strong>stabilize a character</strong> who has a critical harm box filled, roll+sharp. You need appropriate equipment to do this, such as adrenaline shots, or something to stop blood loss, any will do &ndash; if you don't, take -2 to this roll.</p>
<ul>
	<li>On a 10+ you <em>stabilize</em> them, and it doesn't get worse by itself anymore.</li>
	<li>On a 7-9 you <em>stabilize</em> them, and you choose one from the list below.</li>
	<li>On a 6- you don't stabilize them, and the GM chooses one from the list below.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>It takes you a lot of time, or you caused some other problem in the process: They suffer 1-harm, ignoring armor.</li>
	<li>You just bought time: They are stabilized for now, but they become destabilized again after a day, or earlier if they do anything other than resting.</li>
	<li>You missed something important: The GM may do a move of their choice.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Treat wounds</h3>
<p>When you <strong>tend to someone's wounds</strong>, that is when you want to initiate recovery for someone who has a wounded harm box filled, you need just need appropriate equipment to do this, no roll required. Appropriate equipment means bandages, something to close the wounds, a cast or splint and sling for broken bones, whatever makes sense in that situation.</p>

	
<h3>Supply</h3><!-- should be unified with the other supply-like moves -->
<p>When you <strong>are looking to buy something</strong>, and it is something readily available, you can buy it at market price. Otherwise, if it is something special, beyond what is usually available here, roll+sharp.</p>
<ul>
	<li>On a 10+ you find what you're looking for at a fair price.</li>
	<li>On a 7-9 the GM chooses one from the list below.</li>
	<li>On a 6- the GM chooses one from the list below, and it costs 1-wealth more.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>It costs 1-wealth more than usually.</li>
	<li>It is not for sale, but you find something similar or close.</li>
	<li>It is not openly for sale, but you find someone who knows someone who's selling it, and can lead you to them.</li>
	<li>It is not for sale, but you find someone who sold it recently and could lead you to the buyer.</li>
	<li>It is not in stock, but they are waiting for a re-supply or they could order it somewhere.</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Prepare</h3>
<p>When you <strong>spend your leisure time in study, research, or hard practice</strong> you gain preparation. If you prepare &#133;</p>
<ul class="Ellipsis">
	<li>for a week or two, 1 preparation.</li>
	<li>for a month or longer, 3 preparation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When your preparation pays off, spend 1 preparation for +1 to any roll. You can only spend one preparation per roll.</p>

	
<h3>Carouse</h3>
<p>When you <strong>return triumphant and throw a big party</strong>, spend 1-wealth and roll+wealth spent additionall.</p>
<ul>
	<li>On a 10+ choose 3.</li>
	<li>On a 7-9 choose 1.</li>
	<li>On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>You befriend a useful NPC</li>
	<li>You hear rumors of an opportunity</li>
	<li>You gain useful information</li>
	<li>You're safe from trouble &ndash; not choosing this does not that you are in danger, but choosing it means that you are definitely safe.</li>
</ul>

	<h3>Reputation</h3><!-- driver -->
	<p>When you meet someone important (your call), roll+cool.</p><!-- roll+background? -->
	<ul>
		<li>On a hit, they’ve heard of you, and you say what they’ve heard; the MC has them respond accordingly.</li>
		<li>On a 10+, you take +1forward for dealing with them as well.</li>
		<li>On a 6-, they have heard of you, but the GM decides what they have heard.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This move does not make the person in question important in any absolute sense, it's just whether you character thinks the person is.</p>
	<p>If you use this move on another PC, that player has the character respond, instead of the GM, naturally.</p>



	<!-- <h3>Daredevil</h3>
	<p>If you go straight into danger without hedging your bets you get +1armor. If you happen to be leading a gang or convoy, it gets +1armor, too.</p>-->
	
	<!-- <h3>Collector</h3><!-- driver -->
	<!-- <h3>My other car is a tank</h3><!-- driver -->
	
	<!-- <h3>Eye on the door</h3><!-- driver -->
	<!-- <h3>Fuck this shit</h3><!-- gunlugger -->
	
	<!-- <h3>Prepared for the inevitable</h3><!-- gunlugger -->



	<h3>Not to be fucked with</h3><!-- gunlugger -->
	<p>In battle you count as a small gang, with harm and armor according to your gear.</p>



	<h3>Disciplined engagement</h3><!-- quarantine -->
	<p>When you inflict harm, you can choose exactly how much harm you want to inflict, but never more than your weapon and moves would normally allow.</p>

	
	
	<h3>Exit strategy</h3>
	<p>Name your escape route and roll+hard.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+, sweet, you're gone.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9, you can go or stay, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind, or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.</li>
		<li>On a miss, you're caught vulnerable, half in and half out.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Frenzy</h3><!-- hocus -->
	<p>When you <strong>agitate a mob</strong>, roll+genius.</p><!-- maybe: roll+hot? -->
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+, hold 3.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9, hold 1.</li>
		<li>On a 6-, the mob turns on you.</li>
	<ul>
	<p>Spend your hold 1 for 1 to make the mob:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>bring people forward and deliver them.</li>
			<li>bring forward all their precious things.</li>
			<li>unite and fight for you as a gang (2harm, 0-armor, size appropriate).</li>
			<li>fall into an orgy of uninhibited emotion: fucking, lamenting, fighting, sharing, celebrating, as you choose.</li>
			<li>go quietly back to their lives.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>If you make the mob bring people forward and deliver them, they have to be people within the mob's reach, and few enough that the mob can overpower them. Otherwise, the GM is allowed to have the mob decline or its victims resist, but then it does not use up the player's hold.</p>



	<h3>Fingers in every pie</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>put out the word that you want a thing</strong> and have own establishment or know some people, roll+hot.</p>
	<p>The thing could be a person, could be equipment, gear, whatever you like, could even be just a thing.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+, it shows up in your establishment for you, as you wanted it.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9, well, your people make an effort and everybody wants to please. You get a thing that is close to what you want, or the thing you want just got closer, your choice.</li>
		<li>On a miss, it shows up in your establishment for you with strings wicked attached.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is legit to tell player that the thing they want simply is not available this way, even on a 10+, if the thing they want really isn't available this way.</p>



	<h3>Everybody eats, even that guy</h3>
	<p>When you want to know something about someone important (your call), roll+hot.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ you can ask 3 questions.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9, you can ask 1 question.</li>
		<li>On a 6-, you can ask 1 question anyway, but they hear about your interest in them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Choose from the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How are they doing? what's up with them?</li>
		<li>What or who do they love best?</li>
		<li>Who do they know, like and/or trust?</li>
		<li>When next should I expect to see them?</li>
		<li>How could I get to them, physically or emotionally?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This move does not make the person in question important in any absolute sense, it's just whether you character thinks the person is.</p>
	<p>If you use this move on another PC, that player has the character respond, instead of the GM, naturally.</p>
		
	<!--h3>Background</h3>
	<p>When you take this move, <strong>choose an area of expertise</strong>.</p>
	<p>When you <strong>first encounter a situation that is covered by your lore</strong> you can ask the GM any one question about it; the GM will answer truthfully.
	The GM may then ask you what tale, song, or legend you heard that information in.</p-->

<h2>Asset moves</h2>

		
	<h3>Gang</h3>
	<p>You have a small gang, any you are their leader. When you take this move, choose your relationship with the gang:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It is a professional relationship. You give the orders, they follow them, the hierarchy is clear. You get their service, they get something in return. If so, take the circumstancial move <strong>Leadership</strong>.</li>
		<li>It is a personal relationship. You are all in it together, for some reason or the other. At the moment you are the leader, because they trust your decisions or because they have no other choice, but this may change. If so, take the circumstancial move <strong>Pack Alpha</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Keep this move when interacting with the gang. If you have several gangs, for example because you hired some mercenaries, choose the relationship separately for each gang.</p>
	<p>Regarding the choices, the professional relationship makes most sense if the gang is bound to you by money, duty, contracts, etc. That is, if they are professional soldiers, hired mercenaries, an honor guard and so on.</p>
	<p>The personal relationship makes more sense for tribal warbands, bandits, thieves, a group of survivors, etc. where personal ties, relationships, and trust play a huge role regarding hierarchy and authority.</p>

		
	<h3>Pack alpha (gang move)</h3><!-- chopper -->
	<p>When you try to <strong>impose your will on your gang or troops</strong>, roll+hard.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+, they follow your order without a complaint.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9, choose one:<ul>
			<li>they do what you want (otherwise they refuse)</li>
			<li>they don't fight back over it (otherwise they do fight back, and inflict harm against you)</li>
			<li>you don't have to make an example of one of them (otherwise you must, and you inflict harm against them)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>On a miss, someone in your gang makes a bid, idle or serious, to replace you for alpha.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The important part here to roll only when you impose your will &ndash; that is <strong>not</strong> whenever you give an order.</p>
	<p>Just to lay it right out &ndash; on a 7-9, the player's choices are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>they do what you want, after a fight in which they beat the shit out of you but you make an example of one of them</li>
		<li>they don't do what you want, but you make an example of one of them and so they don't beat the shit out of you</li>
		<li>you don't make an example of one of them, so they beat the shit out of you and don't do what you want.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Making a bid, even a serious one, does not mean taking it on as an all-consuming life goal or anything like that. It just means one fully intent challenge to the character's authority.</p>
	
	<h3>Leadership (gang move)</h3><!-- hardholder -->
	<p>when you <strong>order your gang or troops</strong> to advance, regroup, hold position, hold discipline, or put effort into it, roll+hot.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+, they snap to, and do it &ndash; take +1 to your next roll.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9, they do it.</li>
		<li>On a 6-, they do it, but you'll hear about it later.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When your order constitutes making a move with your gang, such as unleash violence or doing battle, you should roll leadership first, so that the +1 applies to that move.</p>
	<p>When the order does not constitute a move, the +1forward is simply applied to whatever you do next.</p>
	<p>On a miss, be sure to have the gang make an issue of the order later.</p>

	<h3>Holding</h3>
	<p>You have a small holding, that is you have rule over <strong>population and their infrastructure</strong> as a leader and administrator, keeping them all together. Take the circumstancial move <strong>Administration</strong>.</p>
	<p>The most obvious form of a holding is an actual holding: a village, fort or refuge, where you rule over the local citizens. Still, it can also be a guild, corporation, or other kind of organization, and the boundaries between a holding and followers may be a little blurry.</p>
	<p>If you provide order, structure, security in return for a share of the people's wealth, then what you have is most likely a holding.</p>

	<h3>Administration (holding move)</h3><!-- hardholder --><!-- worth more, because his hold is better than when other characters get one -->
	<p>If your hold is secure and your rule unchallenged, at the beginning of the session, roll+cool.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>On a 10+, you have surplus at hand and available for the needs of the session.</li>
	<li>On a 7-9, you have surplus, but choose 1 want.</li>
	<li>On a 6-, or if your hold is compromised or your rule contested your hold is in want.</li><!-- in want: all effects of the want. -->
	</ul>
	<p>The precise values of your surplus and want depend on your holding.</p>
	<p>The GM should not open a session with the hold being newly insecure or your rule being newly challenged, when at the end of the last session it was not so.</p>
	<p>Those are the kinds of things that can only, and should only, happen in play, during the session.</p>
	

	<h3>Followers</h3>
	<p>You have a group of followers, people who believe in you, admire you for your deeds, skills, performances, people who share the same ideas, beliefs, philosophy. Take the circumstancial move <strong>Fortunes</strong>.</p>
	<p>Followers can be your family, staff, students, maybe a spy network. You are their object of admiration, idol, prophet, savior.</p>
	<p>If you and they profit from one another in some way, then what you have is most likely followers. Another key point here is that they focus on you as a person.</p>
	
	<h3>Fortunes (followers move)</h3><!-- hocus -->
	<p>At the beginning of the session, roll+fortune (the followers' stat).</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+, your followers have surplus.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9, they have surplus, but choose 1 want.</li>
		<li>On a 6-, they are in want.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Fortune, surplus and want all depend on your followers.</p>
	<p>If their surplus lists wealth, like 1-wealth or 2-wealth, that's your personal share, to spend for what you will.</p>


	<h3>Establishment</h3>
	<p>You own an establishment, that is you have <strong>regular customers</strong> and <strong>one can find useful information there</strong>.</p>
	<p>Usually this is a bar or similar place where people can relax and enjoy themselves. Still, a lawyer's office could be an establishment, too, or a thieves guild, secret society, a sports club.</p>
		
		
	<h3>Equipment</h3>
	<p>You have access to things that normal people cannot get their hands on easily, or access to the raw materials and the knowledge that is necessary to manufacture such things in a workspace.</p>
	<p>When you take this move, <strong>specify what kind of gear or resources</strong> you have access to. You can take this move multiple times, each time with a different thing &ndash; and you can of course take it multiple times and stay in the same area of gear, but get access to more and more rare items.</p>
	<p>You do not need this move to get access to readily available, but expensive equipment, no. This is reserved for stuff that is restricted by legal regulations, or straight out illegal.</p>
	<p>As a rule of thumb, if an ordinary person could believably buy it somewhere without too much of a hassle, or get it by doing some things and filling out paper work &ndash; then it is readily available. This, naturally, depends on the environment and setting you are playing in.</p>
	<p>The things that clearly fall into this category are usually special types of medication, drugs, military equipment and weapons, rare pieces of art, and as told before, all kinds of illegal things.</p>
	<!--<p>When you want to get your hands on one of these things, roll+1 &ndash; or roll-1 if you want a whole batch.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>On a 10+ you find what you are looking for at a fair price.</li>
	<li>On a 7-9 you'll have to pay more, wait longer, or settle for something close.</li>
	</ul>-->



	<h3>Insider</h3>
	<p>You have access to circles of society that normal people don't get into easily.</p>
	<p>When you take this move, <strong>specify what kind of community you are a part of</strong>. You can take this move multiple times, each time with a different type of people.</p>
	<p>Use this to get into elitist circles, secret societies, the underworld, criminal organziations, basically anything that is not part of the life of most of society.</p>



	<h3>Large investment</h3>
	<p>You own something that is worth several years of savings. It is completely yours, no matter how you got it, but spell out how you got it, because that makes an interesting story after all, and the GM and other players may pick up on it.</p>
	<p>This could be a luxury item, such as a large yacht, one or two customized vehicles, a large collection of expensive things (including weapons), your own estate, a small palace.</p>



	<h3>Workspace</h3>
	<p>You own a specialized workspace, including the tools and equipment to run it properly, and maybe some staff.</p>
	<p>Choose which of the following your workspace includes. Choose 3:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>skilled labor</li>
		<li>a storage of raw materials</li>
		<li>a medium sized transport vehicle</li>
		<li>higher quality tools</li>
		<li>a garage or stable</li>
		<li>a proving range</li>
		<li>a relic, or obscure devices</li>
		<li>communication equipment</li>
		<li>a controlled environment, for growing, testing, mixing or isolating things</li>
		<li>a safe to lock away things (not people)</li>
		<li>a cell to lock away people (and maybe things)</li>
		<li>a darkroom</li>
		<li>traps</li>
		<li>secret passages or compartments</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can use workspaces to work on projects, granted that it makes sense with the materials and tools that you have available.</p>
	<p>Of course, you can come up with other options for your workspace.</p>

	<p>Will you leave them behind, or stay around, maybe even as an ally? You could also choose a meaningful death.</p>
	<p>However, if you want your character to live, the GM cannot simply kill them off or turn them into your enemy later (unless that's your plan, of course).</p>
		
	<h3>Create an additional character</h3>
	<p>Play a second or third character, no problem. One advice though: Play the friends or associates of the other players' characters, not your own.</p>
