<h2>Stats</h2>

	<p>Characters have the following stats:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Wise</strong> means calm, patient, keeping your head, having a great deal of experience and knowledge.</li><!-- slow, cold -->
		<li><strong>Charm</strong> means inspiring, enticing, interesting, good with people.</li><!-- fast, hot -->
		<li><strong>Hard</strong> means hard-hearted, , violent, aggressive.</li><!-- slow, hot -->
		<li><strong>Sharp</strong> means sharp-witted, alert, smart, perceptive, cunning.</li><!-- fast, cold -->
		<li><strong>Spirit</strong> means strong-willed, passionate, interesting.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Stats can go from -3 to +3, but are usually from -1 to +2. That's the number you add or subtract from your roll when you roll+that stat.</p>
	<p>If a rule says, for instance, &ldquo;you get stat+3&rdquo;, that means your stat goes to +3, no matter what it was before. If it says &ldquo;you get +1 stat&rdquo;, that means that you increase your current stat by 1.</p>
	
	<h3>Assigning stats</h3>
	<p>When you create a new character, pick one array and assign its values to your stats:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>+3, 0, 0, -1, -1</li>
		<li>+2, +2, 0, -1, -1</li>
		<li>+2, +1, +1, 0, -1</li>
		<li>+2, +1, 0, 0, 0</li>
	</ul>
	<!-- You can create other arrays, using a point-buy-method. You get 9 points.
	<table>
		<tr><th>Stat Value</th><th>Point Cost</th>
		<tr>-1<td></td><td>0</td></tr>
		<tr> 0<td></td><td>1</td></tr>
		<tr>+1<td></td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr>+2<td></td><td>4</td></tr>
		<tr>+3<td></td><td>7</td></tr>
	</table>
    <p>If you do so, keep in mind that some combinations might just not be interesting, because they create either a one-trick-pony or a character that is not really bad or good at anything.</p>
	<p>Another variation had 14 points and costs of -2/0, -1/1, 0/2,  +1/3, +2/5, +3/8, but we decided against -2, because it makes you get a dump stat essentially.</p>-->
