<h2>Stats</h2>

	<p>Characters have the following stats:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Wise</strong> means calm, patient, keeping your head, having a great deal of experience and knowledge.</li><!-- slow, cold -->
		<li><strong>Charm</strong> means inspiring, enticing, interesting, good with people.</li><!-- fast, hot -->
		<li><strong>Hard</strong> means hard-hearted, , violent, aggressive.</li><!-- slow, hot -->
		<li><strong>Sharp</strong> means sharp-witted, alert, smart, perceptive, cunning.</li><!-- fast, cold -->
		<li><strong>Spirit</strong> means strong-willed, passionate, interesting.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Stats can go from -3 to +3, but are usually from -1 to +2. That's the number you add or subtract from your roll when you roll+that stat.</p>
	<p>If a rule says, for instance, &ldquo;you get stat+3&rdquo;, that means your stat goes to +3, no matter what it was before. If it says &ldquo;you get +1 stat&rdquo;, that means that you increase your current stat by 1.</p>
	
	<h3>Assigning stats</h3>
	<p>When you create a new character, pick one array and assign its values to your stats:</p>
	<table>
		<tr><td>&#x2734;  </td><td align="right">+3,</td><td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">-1,</td><td align="right">-1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&#x2734;  </td><td align="right">+2,</td><td align="right">+2,</td><td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">-1,</td><td align="right">-1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&#x2734;  </td><td align="right">+2,</td><td align="right">+1,</td><td align="right">+1,</td><td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">-1</td></tr>
		<tr><td>&#x2734;  </td><td align="right">+2,</td><td align="right">+1,</td><td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">0,</td> <td align="right">0</td></tr>
	</table>
	<!-- You can create other arrays, using a point-buy-method. You get 9 points.
	<table>
		<tr><th>Stat Value</th><th>Point Cost</th>
		<tr>-1<td></td><td>0</td></tr>
		<tr> 0<td></td><td>1</td></tr>
		<tr>+1<td></td><td>2</td></tr>
		<tr>+2<td></td><td>4</td></tr>
		<tr>+3<td></td><td>7</td></tr>
	</table>
    <p>If you do so, keep in mind that some combinations might just not be interesting, because they create either a one-trick-pony or a character that is not really bad or good at anything.</p>
	<p>Another variation had 14 points and costs of -2/0, -1/1, 0/2,  +1/3, +2/5, +3/8, but we decided against -2, because it makes you get a dump stat essentially.</p>-->
	
	<h3>Backgrounds</h3>
	<p>Backgrounds tell something about the history of your character: where they grew up, what they learned, who they know. Backgrounds are used in certain moves and go from +1 to +3.</p>
	<p>When you create a new character, <strong>assign 3 background points</strong>: one background at +3, or one at +2 and one at +1, or three at +1 each.</p>
	<p>You can give each background a description, add some notes to it. It should be descriptive enough so that you can later tell what it was about, and it can relate to a location, event, item, or person, or whatever you can think of.</p>

<h2>Basic moves</h2>
	
	<h3>Defy Danger</h3>
	<p>when you <strong>act despite an imminent threat</strong> or <strong>suffer a calamity</strong> say how you deal with it. If you do it &#133;</p>
	<ul class="Ellipsis">
		<li>by powering through, roll+hard.</li>
		<li>by acting fast or getting out of the way, roll+sharp</li>
		<li>with quick thinking, roll+sharp</li>
		<li>with mental fortitude, roll+versed</li>
		<li>with charm and social grace, roll+</li>
		<li>by playing a role or deceiving someone, roll+</li>
	</ul><ul>
		<li>On a 10+ you do what you set out to do, the danger does not come to bear.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 you stumble, hesitate, or flinch. The GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or an ugly choice.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Deescalate</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>stand up to violence</strong>, roll+hard.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ choose 3.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 choose 1.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Choose from these options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>They back off and put their weapons away.</li>
		<li>They don't harm anyone else.</li>
		<li>They don't ask for compensation.</li>
		<li>You don't suffer any harm.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>TODO - This needs some clarification, to be honest. Whats the difference to defend? Is the violence already going on and you try to stop it? If the guys set out to kill someone, then they sure won't stop because of someone barging in. The options read as if: they hurt someone else, ask for compensation, inflict harm and stay there.</p>

	<h3>Defend</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>rush in to defend an item, location, or person under attack</strong> roll+swift if it is a physical attack, or roll+charm if they are just talking.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ choose 3.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 choose 1.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Redirect the attack to yourself.</li>
		<li>The attacker gets some of what they want, but not all of it. If they want to cause harm, reduce the harm by 1.</li>
		<li>Deal harm as established to the attacker, reduced by 1.</li>
		<li>You create an opportunity for an ally to fall in, giving advantage to the first ally that takes the opportunity.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Deceive</h3>
	<p>When you try to <strong>seduce, manipulate,goad, or trick someone</strong>, tell them what you want them to do, give them a reason, and roll+charm.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ they go along with you, unless or until some fact or action betrays the reason you gave them.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 as above, but they want some concrete assurance or evidence first.</li>
		<li>If you deceive another player and they go along with you, they mark experience, but they can still refuse the offer and get nothing instead.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Use this when you want someone to do something for you, without doing anything in return. In order to do so, you need leverage that you can hold against them: a reason, a threat, a promise, or something that the character can really do that the victim really wants or does not want.</p>
	<p>If the NPC needs assurance, it should directly address the leverage that the character is using. The leverage is sex? The assurance should be sexual. The assurance is violence? They want a promise that you won't hurt them.</p>
	<p>In case there is no leverage this move does not apply &ndash; they are just talking, and your NPCs should agree or refuse according to their own interests.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Read a Situation</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>attempt to find out the truth</strong> in a tense situation and &#133;</p>
	<ul class="Ellipsis">
		<li>you have time to carefully check things out, study and analyze, thinking something through: roll+versed.</li>
		<li>you take a quick glance and go by instinct: roll+sharp.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On a hit you can ask the GM questions. Whenever you act on the answers you have advantage.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ you get to ask three questions.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 you get to ask one question.</li>
		<li>On a 6- you get to ask one question anyway, but be prepared for the worst.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A character cannot read the same situation more than once.</p>
	<p>As a GM you may already know the answers, or you have to make something up. In the latter case you can also ask the players to help you answer, especially if the situation is one of the character&rsquo; making.</p>
	<p>Either way, you have to commit to the answers being true when you give them, that's what the +1 is good for.</p>
	<p>The questions can be arbitrary, but before you answer, tell the player whether that would use up one of their questions. Asking about mere facts does not use up a question, and the players should be aware of that.</p>
	<p>Here's a list of questions that will likely come up:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What happened here recently?</li>
		<li>What is about to happen?</li>
		<li>What should I be on the lookout for?</li>
		<li>What here is useful or valuable to me?</li>
		<li>Who's really in control here?</li>
		<li>What here is not what it appears to be?</li>
		<li>Where is my best escape route / way in / way out?</li>
		<li>Which enemy is most vulnerable to me?</li>
		<li>Which enemy is the biggest threat?</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Read a Person</h3>
	<p>When you read a <strong>read a person in a charged situation</strong>, roll+sharp.</p>
	<p>While you are interacting with them you get to ask questions about them over the course of the interaction. Whenever you act on the answers you have advantage.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ you get to ask three questions.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 you get to ask one question.</li>
		<li>On a 6- you get to ask one question anyway, but be prepared for the worst.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Choose from the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Is your character telling the truth?</li>
		<li>What is your character really feeling?</li>
		<li>What does your character intend to do?</li>
		<li>What does your character wish I would do?</li>
		<li>How could I get your character to &#133;?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Reading a person means studying their behaviour carefully throughout the entire conversation, noticing changes in their tone, their gestures and facial expressions, movement of the eyes.</p>
	<p>Roll this only when (a) the interaction really matters and (b) you're going to play the interaction through.</p>
	<p>As a GM you may already know the answers, or you have to make something up. Either way, you have to commit to the answers being true when you give them, and most likely the other person does not expect you knowing about that &ndash; that's what the +1 is good for.</p>
	<p>As a player you can make the roll at the very beginning of the conversation, or at any point during it. It's fair to wait for just the right opportunity to ask the question, and there is no rush to ask all questions before the conversation ends: At the end of interaction you can ask any of the remaining questions.</p>
	<p>During the interaction it can occur that you want to make a different move, such as talking sense into someone or put leverage on them. That's OK, and remember that you get +1 when you use the knowledge you gained from one of the answers.</p>
	<p>Finally, you cannot keep reading someone again and again unless there was a significant change in between. Players reading each other is also not a problem &ndash; they just roll and get to ask each other questions as they go along with the conversation.</p>

	<h3>Aid or Interfere</h3>
	<p>When you <strong>help or hinder someone</strong>, roll+an appropriate background or stat.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>On a 10+ they take +2 <em>(help)</em> or -2 <em>(interfere)</em> to their roll.</li>
		<li>On a 7-9 they take +1 <em>(help)</em> or -1 <em>(interfere)</em> to their roll.</li>
		<li>On a 6- you expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The used stat or background should be appropriate for what you want to establish in the fiction.</p> 

<ul>
<li>On a 10+ you</li>
<li>On a 7-9 you</li>
<li>On a 6- you</li>
