<h2>Harm</h2>
<p>Harm is an abstract means to describe damage to a living being or thing. Harm</p>
<ul class="Ellipsis">
	<li>is the result of certain moves. Certain GM moves allow inflicting harm on the characters, others allow the characters and their adversaries to inflict harm on eachother.</li>
	<li>can be, but usually is not, the effect of a single event in the fiction. So, when you exchange harm with another character that does not mean that they both hit each other simultaneously &ndash; they rather do a few attacks, maybe they get the chance for a strong hit or they land some minor blows. </li>
	<li>is something that you want to avoid. As in real life, people don't like to get hurt, and they usually won't fight to death.</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Inflicting harm</h3>
<p>Certain moves tell you to inflict or suffer harm. The amount of harm that the victim suffers depends on the source of the harm and the victim's armor:</p>
<p>harm suffered = harm inflicted - victim's armor</p>
<p>Usually when harm is inflicted the source of the harm and thus the amount that would be inflicted has already been established, for example if someone threatens you with their weapon it will be the amount of harm that this weapon inflicts.</p>
<p>Be honest with the players and tell them the amount of harm if they don't know it yet. After all, their characters would be able to judge the severity of the threat, too.</p>
<p>Similarly, it may occur that some characters are threatening eachother with weapons and are about to deal harm, but it hasn't been established yet what weapons they are using. In such a situation establish the weapons used and ask if someone wants to change their mind, because the character would have known beforehand.</p>

<h4>Scale for harm</h4>
<p>Here is an overview to give you a rough idea how much harm something inflicts. This may come in useful for situations where no weapons are used, or if you are designing your own weapons.</p>

<h4>Exchanging harm</h4>
<p>Certain moves tell you to exchange harm, that means that both sides simultaneously inflict and suffer harm, as established by the weapons they are using.</p>

<h3>Harm and characters</h3>

<h4>Scale for individuals</h4>
<p>PCs and NPCs alike suffer harm in the same way. The amount of harm they received means roughly the following:</p>
<p><strong>1-harm</strong>: bruises, lacerations, superficial damage, concussion, pain.</p>
<p><strong>2-harm</strong>: broken bones, wounds, severe pain, shock.</p>
<p><strong>3-harm</strong>: terrible wounds, shock, terrible pain or unconciousness. Fatal without medical attention. Permanent damage likely.</p>
<p><strong>4-harm</strong>: mangled and ruined, immediately fatal or death within a few minutes, most likely disfigured if you survive it.</p>
<p><strong>5-harm and more</strong>: fatal, increasingly destructive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For each 1-harm that a character suffers, they have to check one of their free harm boxes. Characters have the following harm boxes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 <em>bruised</em> box. This kind of harm will go away by itself.</li>
	<li>1 <em>wounded</em> box. It is painful, but does not get better or worse by itself.</li>
	<li>3 <em>critical</em> boxes. It will get worse with time, unless the character's condition is stabilized. When the last critical box is filled, the character <strong>takes their last breath</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The boxes are checked in order, beginning at <em>bruised</em>, then <em>wounded</em>, then <em>critical</em>.</p>

<h3>Harm and gangs</h3>

<h4>Scale for gangs</h4>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p><strong>1-harm</strong>: a few injured, one or two serious, no casualties.</p>

<p><strong>3-harm</strong>: several casualties, many seriously wounded, majority injured.</p>

<p><strong>3-harm</strong>: serious damage. Multiple functions affected, but can be field-patched. 2-harm can blow through to passengers.</p>
<p><strong>4-harm</strong>: breakdown. Catastrophic functional damage, can be repaired in a workspace but not in the field, or scavanged for spare parts. 3-harm can blow through to passengers.</p>
<p><strong>5-harm and more</strong>: total destruction. Full harm can blow through to passengers.</p>

<h3>Harm and buildings</h3>

<h4>Scale for buildings</h4>
<p>When a building or large structure suffers harm, the harm is <strong>non-cumulative</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>1-harm &ndash; 3-harm</strong>: superficial damage, holes, broken glass or wood, smoke. Harm does not blow through to inhabitants.</p>
<p><strong>4-harm &ndash; 6-harm</strong>: Severe superficial damage, many and/or large holes, windows not intact, building might be burning or smoldering. 2-harm can blow through to inhabitants.</p>
<p><strong>7-harm &ndash; 8-harm:</strong>: Structural damage, strained load-bearing walls or pillars, partial collapse. Building might be ablaze with a raging fire. 4-harm can blow through to inhabitants.</p>
